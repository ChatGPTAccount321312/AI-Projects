# AI Projects

This repo is where I drop all my AI projects, tests, and experiments.  
Some of it works, some of it doesn’t, and some of it might actually turn out pretty cool.  

It’s not meant to be a serious collection of polished code — more like a public notebook. Things are messy, random, and often unfinished, but that’s the fun of it.  

I like exploring AI and trying different approaches. Instead of keeping everything buried on my computer, I’m putting it here so I can look back on it later (and in case anyone else wants to poke around).  

Use any of this however you’d like. I might go back and fix or clean up some of these projects every now and then, but don’t expect everything to be perfect.
